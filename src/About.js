          <h2>What is Spool?</h2>
          <p>
            <a href='/'>Spool</a> takes the experience of channel surfing and
            puts it online.  I hope that you enjoy using it as much as
            I&rsquo;ve enjoyed building it.
          </p>

          <h2>Just &hellip; Why?</h2>
          <p>
            I want to build something frivolous, but in a particular way.
            Inexplicable like <small>MTV</small> or Snapchat.
          </p>

          <h2>How can I contact you?</h2>
          <p>
