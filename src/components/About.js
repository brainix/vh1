        <p>
          <Link to='/'>Spool</Link> takes the experience of channel surfing and
          puts it online.  I hope that you enjoy using it as much as I&rsquo;ve
          enjoyed building it.
        </p>

        <h2>Just &hellip; Why?</h2>
        <p>
          I want to build something frivolous, but in a particular way.
          Inexplicable like <small>MTV</small> or Snapchat.
        </p>

        <h2>How can I contact you?</h2>
        <p>
          Find me on Reddit
          (<a href='https://www.reddit.com/user/Brainix'>u/Brainix</a>),
          email me
          (<a href='mailto:brainix@gmail.com'>brainix@gmail.com</a>),
          or have coffee with me any time in San Francisco.
